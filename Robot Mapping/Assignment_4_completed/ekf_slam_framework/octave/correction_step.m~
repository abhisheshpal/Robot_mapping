% Updates the belief, i. e., mu and sigma after observing landmarks, according to the sensor model

% mu: 2N+3 x 1 vector representing the state mean.

% The current pose estimate of the landmark with id = j is: [mu(2*j+2); mu(2*j+3)]

% z: struct array containing the landmark observations.
% Each observation z(i) has an id z(i).id, a range z(i).range, and a bearing z(i).bearing

% at some point by the robot.
